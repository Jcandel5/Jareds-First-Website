<h1 style= "color:black;">All About Me</h1>
<p class="About-me" style= "color:black; font: arial black";>I grew up in Highlands Ranch, Colorado and graduated from Highlands Ranch Highschool. I was a four year varsity wrestler and baseball player, until I broke my thumb my senior year. I am a very energetic person who loves to do anything that involves the outdoors or build things with my hands. After graduating from highschool I choose to attend the University of Wyoming majoring in bussiness and minoring in accounting. While at the University I took a web design class that allowed my to make my own website and games. I found myself working on the website at all times of the day. After another semester I realized that the University life wasn't quite my style so I decided to prusue a carrer in codeing.I have some previous practice in HTML, CSS and Javascript due to that class at the university and in the past couple months I took the Galvanize Javascript immersive progam. My hope after graduating is to work for a big company with a group of people working together to make a app, website or game.</p>
